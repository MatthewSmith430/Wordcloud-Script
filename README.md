Wordcloud-Script
================

R script to create wordcloud from text document

Example
-------

Here is an example of how to create a wordcloud. I use my PhD thesis as the example text. My PhD thesis can be found at: <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319876899_Corporate_networks_of_international_investment_and_trade>

First I save the document as a .txt file and read into R:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](README_files/figure-markdown_github/pressure-1.png)

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
